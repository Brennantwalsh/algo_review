# Quiz Challenge (24 hours)


### Intro

This challenge is most akin to a take home portion for an interview. You technically have until Sunday morning to complete this, however most challenges will be given without notice, not on the weekend and be required within a small window such as 24 hours. I recommend that you hold yourself to that window (aka. by 9:30 pm on Friday). This is a mock of what you may receive.


Plan before typing code on this challenge. **You will waste so much time if you do not plan out your steps before starting to code.**


### Instructions (from hiring manager)


1. Your code must read the text file (quiz_source_text.txt)
2. You can not change the txt file in anyway.
2. You must convert the text file into structures that ruby can understand.
3. Your code must be dynamic. 
  - If we added 100 more questions with answers, following the same format in the txt file, the quiz app would still work. 
3. Your app must display a pleasing interface to your user in the terminal.
4. The User must be able to answer using multiple choice
5. The User must know if they answered correctly or incorrectly
6. The User must be given the correct answer after each quesiton is submitted
7. The User must be given a score at the end of the quiz.
8. Document how to use this app in a second markdown file.

### Suggested Research Questions (not given in coding challenges)


* Remember: Ruby Docs is going to be more helpful than Stackoverflow.
* How do you open and read a text file in ruby?
* What is a `positive lookbehind assertion` in Ruby Regex?
* What does `b(.+)` mean? and how could this combine with a positive lookbehind assertion? [Rubular](http://rubular.com/)
* How do you return the matching portion of a string, using regex?
* Would a case statement be helpful? What is a ruby case statement?


### Bonus (recommendation from hiring manager)

Testing is a common portion of these coding challenges, I recommend that you test afterwards as a bonus or try TDD to develop your quiz app.

* Create a seperate spec.rb file, that runs rspec
* Write tests for your methods
* Then refactor

### Show Some Personality (not prompted by hiring manager)

* after you complete the challenge, you can make a new txt file with your own multiple choice questions. Choose a topic and create as many questions as you like. 

Showing your personality can increase the potential for getting hired. Remember to show who you are, your humor or interests, but be tasteful. This is something that you could add as a side piece to your challenge. In our make believe coding interview process this was not asked for by the hiring manager, but they've been looking at the same code all day - this does four things.

1. Shows that you go beyond the bare minimum 
2. Makes you stand out just because it's different
3. Hiring managers want to hire a person that will get along with the group, humor or personal interest helps them see that
4. Entertains the Hiring Manager, they may have done this alot and they are bored

Note: When adding these fun pieces, don't let it get in the way of them assessing your skills. Always include it as a side or second file.
