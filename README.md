# Coding Challenges

### Basic Planning for Writing Algorithms

1. What is the information that I am starting with? ex: array, hash, integer, string, etc.
2. What is the information or result that I am expecting?
3. Write out the steps in plain english necassary to complete my logic (it's useful to force yourself to use non coding words.)

### Challenges

All challenges today only work in ruby, not rails.

1. ARGV Practice
2. Other Enumerables (learn about yield)
3. Quiz Challenge (24 hours to complete)

#### Instructions

Fork this repo, then clone to your computer. You will push your answers up to github. Note: The README.md files will be easier to view on github.

These are exercises will give you skills you may need for coding challenges in the interview process. Do not waste time. Your goal is to complete all three in 24 hours. 

Challenges 1 and 2 should be finished during class and you should start the Quiz Challenge before leaving. You must solve these challenges in the order above and show a TA or myself your solution.

I recommend that you practice in groups of 2 but everyone must sumbit their own work.
