# ARGV


### Intro

This should be an easy challenge. ARGV is a way to get information from the command line into your ruby (not rails) app. It's time to solve a problem like a rubist.

[Breifly read up on ARGV](http://jnoconor.github.io/blog/2013/10/13/a-short-explanation-of-argv/), you don't need to understand it fully to use it.


### Instructions

*  Your goal is to write only a couple lines of ruby to take in a list of names from the command line and then print those names in order according to length.

Example:


type in terminal

    $ ruby argv_solution.rb stewart james sue billy


expected output printed to the terminal

    sue
    james
    billy
    stewart
